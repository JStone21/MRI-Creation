Formats USB devices and copies files for creation of Geek Squad MRI Drive

I created this script because manually creating the flash drives was overly tedious and time consuming, especially if to make multiples.

All this script really does is make a list of USB devices, clean and format them to FAT32, and copy files over to the root of the newly formatted drive.
